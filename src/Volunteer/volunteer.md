    <p>At FurEver Home Pet Rescue, we believe that our volunteers are the heart and soul of our organization. By volunteering, you help provide homeless animals with the care, attention, and love they need while they wait for their forever homes. Volunteers are integral to the success of our rescue efforts and play an essential role in giving animals a second chance at life.</p>

    <h3 class="subsection-title">How You Can Help</h3>
    <p>There are many ways you can make an impact as a volunteer. Some of the most common ways to help include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fostering</strong> – Temporarily opening your home to a rescue pet gives them a better chance at finding a forever home.</li>
      <li><strong>Dog Walking</strong> – Take dogs out for walks to get them exercise and socialization, which helps them be more adoptable.</li>
      <li><strong>Pet Socialization</strong> – Spend time with pets in our care to help them feel more comfortable and trusting with people.</li>
      <li><strong>Event Support</strong> – Help at adoption events, fundraisers, or other community outreach efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative Assistance</strong> – Assist with behind-the-scenes tasks such as answering calls, scheduling appointments, or organizing records.</li>
    </ul>
